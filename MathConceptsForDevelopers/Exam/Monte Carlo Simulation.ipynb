    "## Abstract\n",
    "In this work some definitions of the Monte Carlo Simulation was given as well a brief overview of the benefits of simulating in various areas of the human list of activities. After that 4 simple functions were investigated (one with 2 degrees of freedom) and integrated using analytical approach, classical trapezoidal rule numerical integration and the proposed Monte Carlo Integration. The Monte Carlo approach is much slower and not so accurate in compare with the classical trapezoidal rule but for solvable and rather simple functions with 1 up to 2 dimensions. The true power of the Monte Carlo Integration was not demonstrated (for integrating of functions with more degrees of freedom). In the end a Monte Carlo Simulation was used to analyse some Texas Hold'em poker situations and improve decision making processes."

    "## 1) Simulation definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A simulation is is a fictitious representation of reality. A simulation is an approximate imitation of the operation of a process or system. In terms of computer simulation, it is an attempt to model a real-life or hypothetical situation on a computer so that it can be studied to see how the system works. By changing variables in the simulation, predictions may be made about the behaviour of the system. It is a tool to virtually investigate the behaviour of the system under study.\n",

    "### 1.1) Use of simulation in science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually the simulation is used by creating a virtual model or smaller/cheaper replica of the studied scientific phenomena or object of interest. The closer the simulation parameters are to the real object of investigation, the more reliable the simulation will be. The simulation can be very complex or quite simple. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example drawing one pseudo-random uniform variable from the interval [0,1] can be used to simulate the tossing of a coin: If the value is less than or equal to 0.50 designate the outcome as heads, but if the value is greater than 0.50 designate the outcome as tails. The author's favourite tossing coin simulation is running his phone's chronometer. When he press the stop button (without looking at the numbers of the chronometer) he observes the figure of hundreds (milliseconds). If the number is even, the result of the simulation is heads (for example) and if it's odd - the result is tail. The simulation should yield close to fair 50/50 percent chance for either even or odd result. As does the tossing of fair coin."

    "### 1.2) Simulation usefulness?\n",
    "\n",
    "In every scientific aspect of the human civilization there is place for simulation, especially if the real tests are too slow, too expensive or virtually impossible. Issues such as cost, safety, scope, time and scale can be overcome by the use of a scientific simulation. One of the primary advantages of simulators is that they are able to provide users with practical feedback when designing real world systems. This allows the designer to determine the correctness and efficiency of a design before the system is actually constructed. Consequently, the user may explore the merits of alternative designs without actually physically building the systems. By investigating the effects of specific design decisions during the design phase rather than the construction phase, the overall cost of building the system diminishes significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of simulators is that they permit system designers to study a problem at several different levels of abstraction. By approaching a system at a higher level of abstraction, the designer is better able to understand the behaviours and interactions of all the high level components within the system and is therefore better equipped to counteract the complexity of the overall system. This complexity may simply overwhelm the designer if the problem had been approached from a lower level. As the designer better understands the operation of the higher level components through the use of the simulator, the lower level components may then be designed and subsequently simulated for verification and performance evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, simulators can be used as an effective means for teaching or demonstrating concepts to students. This is particularly true of simulators that make intelligent use of computer graphics and animation. Such simulators dynamically show the behaviour and relationship of all the simulated system's components, thereby providing the user with a meaningful understanding of the system's nature. "

    "## 2) Stochastic simulation and statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best use of statistics is in complex systems that cannot be analysed by any other mean (like classical analytical approach for example). Also when there are too many degrees of freedom or too many dimensions the brute force are way to slow and the classical analytical methods are virtually impossible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The etymology of the word **\"Stochastic\"** originally meant \"pertaining to conjecture\"; from Greek stokhastikos \"able to guess, conjecturing\": from stokhazesthai \"guess\"; from stokhos \"a guess, aim, target, mark\". So whenever one may want to **\"guess\"** what will be the outcome of some complex system that is impossible to calculate otherwise he/she may do that with a Stochastic Simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A stochastic simulation is a simulation that traces the evolution of variables that can change stochastically (randomly) with certain probabilities. With a stochastic model we create a projection which is based on a set of random values. Outputs are recorded and the projection is repeated with a new set of random values of the variables. These steps are repeated until a sufficient amount of data is gathered. In the end, the distribution of the outputs shows the most probable estimates as well as a frame of expectations regarding what ranges of values the variables are more or less likely to fall in."

    "## 3) Monte Carlo simulation (also known as \"Monte Carlo method\")\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different definitions of the Monte Carlo method (for some it is different than Monte Carlo Simulation). Even though there are earlier work on the same ideas, the modern version of the Monte Carlo method was invented in the late 1940s by Stanislaw Ulam, while he was working on nuclear weapons projects at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. Because of the secrecy of the project from one hand and the statistical gambler flavour of the examples from the other, the whole method was named after the casino-rich city state of Monte Carlo. \n",
    "\n",
    "Monte Carlo is an estimation procedure. The main idea is that if it is necessary to know the average value of some random variable and its distribution cannot be stated, and if it is possible to take samples from the distribution, we can estimate it by taking the samples, independently, and averaging them. If there are sufficient samples, then the law of large numbers says the average must be close to the true value. The central limit theorem says that the average has a Gaussian distribution around the true value. Regarding the difference between Monte Carlo Method and Monte Carlo Simulation according to some authors: a Monte Carlo method is a technique that can be used to solve a mathematical or statistical problem, and a Monte Carlo simulation uses repeated sampling to obtain the statistical properties of some phenomenon (or behaviour). As a popular example of their difference:\n",
    "* Monte Carlo Method: Pouring out a box of coins on a table, and then computing the ratio of coins that land heads versus tails is a Monte Carlo method of determining the behaviour  of repeated coin tosses, but it is not a simulation.\n",
    "* Monte Carlo simulation: Drawing a large number of pseudo-random uniform variables from the interval [0,1] at one time, or once at a large number of different times, and assigning values less than or equal to 0.50 as heads and greater than 0.50 as tails, is a Monte Carlo simulation of the behaviour  of repeatedly tossing a coin.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a huge number of applications in almost all fields of human activities: \n",
    "* Physics (including computational physics, physical chemistry, quantum chromodynamics, aerodynamics, statistical physics, molecular dynamics, statistical field theories, radiation materials science, particle physics, astrophysics, weather forecasting, etc.);\n",
    "* Engineering (sensitivity analysis and quantitative probabilistic analysis in process design in areas like microelectronics engineering, geostatistics and  geometallurgy, wind energy, combustion energetics, fluid dynamics, autonomous robotics, telecommunications, reliability engineering, signal processing, etc.)\n",
    "* Climate change and radiative forcing\n",
    "* Computational biology\n",
    "* Computer graphics (path tracing, rendering)\n",
    "* Applied statistics\n",
    "* AI for games\n",
    "* Design and visuals (in VR, 3D games and cinematic special effects, etc.)\n",
    "* Search and rescue\n",
    "* Finance and business (actually there is huge amount of Monte Carlo methods in finance usage for various financial derivatives. Maybe the financial use is one of the most famous)\n",
    "* Law\n",
    "* And of course in mathematics - in deterministic numerical integration, simulations and optimizations and solving inverse problems"

    "## 4) Monte Carlo Simulation in numeric integration\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the integration is that it is very hard or often impossible to perform with classical pen and white paper, following the analytical approach. Fortunately there are very fast and accurate methods using digital sampling and integration, like the trapezoidal rule for example. But these methods also have their limitations as the function might not be arbitrary and the calculations become too slow for more dimensions or degrees of freedom. So here comes the Monte Carlo Simulation which can calculate arbitrarily complex function for arbitrarily large degree of freedom reasonably fast. For example a Monte Carlo Simulations were used to calculate the [Batman Sigil Equation](http://www.sawp.com.br/blog/?p=2076) or even integrating the [Batman Sigil](https://vodeocatalog.com/en/video/AyBNnkYrSWY).\n",

    "In numerical integration, methods such as the trapezoidal rule use a deterministic approach. Monte Carlo integration, on the other hand, employs a non-deterministic approach: each realization provides a different outcome. In Monte Carlo, the final outcome is an approximation of the correct value with respective error bars, and the correct value is likely to be within those error bars.\n",

Lets consider this Texas Hold'em poker situation: At some point the player A and the Player B get to all in (the player with smaller money stack bets all of his stack into the pot and the other player calls the bet). The money amount is irrelevant. Let's assume some percentages for win for each of the players in the preflop stage (the winning odds calculators are not scope of this study and are irrelevant):\n",

    "In this situation if the game is a tournament, the players show their cards, the dealer deals the community cards (the flop, the turn and the river) and the winner gets the money (or they split it if nobody wins and it's draw). But in cash games there are more flexible rule stating that if both the players A and B agree, they can ask the dealer to deal two or more times the community cards using the same deck of cards (like \"lets see if we draw two times the cards who would win). The idea is that the pot is divided on the number of runs (for two runs - the pot is divided by two) and each player gets the part of the pot in which he wins. For example if the players run 3 times the deck, and the Player A wins in the first 2 runs, but the Player B wins in the third run, Player A gets 2/3 of the money and Player B gets 1/3 of the money. Of course if Player A wins in all the runs he gets all the money."

    "* Irrelevant regarding the long term Expected Value\n",
    "* Very crucial in terms of damage control when unlucky and loosing:\n",
    "    * If he is very ahead with about 80% win rate, he reduces the chance to lose 5 times (from 20% to 4%) but on the expense of reducing his immediate win rate from 80% to 63% - very acceptable\n",
    "    * If he is on a flip coin (about 50/50), he reduces twice both the chance to win and to lose - thus not counting on pure luck for to big pots\n",
    "    * If he is underdog with about 30% win rate (or smaller) he greatly reduces his win rate (3x times or more for more underdog situations) but also reduces the chance to lose money from 70% to 45%, and even more for more underdog situation.\n",
    "* The final conclusion is - in big pots, always agree on running twice or more times for the sake of reducing the luck involved, reducing the damage from bad beating and increasing the chance to not lose your money when you're behind."

    "The Monte Carlo Simulation is a very powerful method that has huge amount of applications. In this work the Monte Carlo Interpolation was demonstrated and compared with analytical and classical digital interpolation techniques. Also its use in classical gamble game played in Monte Carlo casinos was demonstrated, by helping a player with the long term decision whether offering/accepting running the cards twice or more times in all in situation is a good option without knowing the opponents cards in Texas Hold'em cash poker table. It turns out that the answer is yes."
